# 0 Introduction
This book has been written to provide a simple and self-contained description of the working and underlying principles of the aero gas turbine engine. The use of complex formulae and the language of the specialist have been avoided to allow for a clear and concise presentation of the essential facts. Only such description and formulae, therefore, as are necessary to the understanding of the function and the theory of the engine are included.

It will be noted that the emphasis in this book is on the turbo-jet engine and that no special part deals with the propeller-turbine engine. This is because the working principles of both engine types are essentially the same. However where differences in function or application do exist, these are described. The aero gas turbine is being continually developed to provide improved performance for each new generation of aircraft; the fourth edition of this book has been revised and expanded to include the latest aero gas engine technology.

### 1.1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1.1 The development of the gas turbine engine as an aircraft power plant has been so rapid that it is difficult to appreciate that prior to the 1950s very few people had heard of this method of aircraft propulsion. The possibility of using a reaction jet had interested aircraft designers for a long time, but initially the low speeds of early aircraft and the unsuitably of a piston engine for producing the large high velocity airflow necessary for the jet presented many obstacles.

1.1.2 A French engineer, René Lorin, patented a jet propulsion engine (fig. 1-1) in 1913, but this was an athodyd (para. 11) and was at that period impossible to manufacture or use, since suitable heat resisting materials had not then been developed and, in the second place, jet propulsion would have been extremely inefficient at the low speeds of the aircraft of those days. However, today the modern ram jet is very similar to Lorin's conception.

1.1.3 In 1930 Frank Whittle was granted his first patent for using a gas turbine to produce a propulsive jet,but it was eleven years before his engine completed its first flight. The Whittle engine formed the basis of the modern gas turbine engine, and from it was developed the Rolls-Royce Welland, Derwent, Nene and Dart engines. The Derwent and Nene turbo-jet engines had world-wide military applications; the Dart turbo-propeller engine became world famous as the power plant for the Vickers Viscount aircraft. Although other aircraft may be fitted; with later engines termed twin-spool, triple-spool, by-pass, ducted fan, unducted fan and propfan, these are inevitable developments of Whittle's early engine.

1.1.4 The jet engine (fig. 1-2), although appearing so different from the piston engine-propeller combination, applies the same basic principles to effect propulsion. As shown in fig. 1-3, both propel their aircraft solely by thrusting a large weight of air backwards

1.1.5 Although today jet propulsion is popularly linked with the gas turbine engine, there are other types of jet propelled engines, such as the ram jet, the pulse jet, the rocket, the turbo/ram jet, and the turbo-rocket.

### 1.2 PRINCIPLES OF JET PROPULSION

1.1.6 Jet propulsion is a practical application of Sir Isaac Newton's third law of motion which states that, 'for every force acting on a body there is an opposite and equal reaction'. For aircraft propulsion, the 'body' is atmospheric air that is caused to accelerate as it passes through the engine. The force required to give this acceleration has an equal effect in the opposite direction acting on the apparatus producing the acceleration. A jet engine produces thrust in a similar way to the engine/propeller combination. Both propel the aircraft by thrusting a large weight of air backwards (fig. 1-3), one in the form of a large air slipstream at comparatively low speed and the other in the form of a jet of gas at very high speed.

1.1.7 This same principle of reaction occurs in all forms of movement and has been usefully applied in many ways. The earliest known example of jet reaction is that of Hero's engine (fig. 1-4) produced as a toy in 120 B.C. This toy showed how the momentum of steam issuing from a number of jets could impart an equal and opposite reaction to the jets themselves, thus causing the engine to revolve.

1.1.8 The familiar whirling garden sprinkler (fig. 1-5) is a more practical example of this principle, for the mechanism rotates by virtue of the reaction to the water jets. The high pressure jets of modern fire-fighting equipment are an example of 'jet reaction', for often, due to the reaction of the water jet, the hose cannot be held or controlled by one fireman. Perhaps the simplest illustration of this principle is afforded by the carnival balloon which, when the air or gas is released, rushes rapidly away in the direction opposite to the jet.

1.1.9 Jet reaction is definitely an internal phenomenon and does not, as is frequently assumed, result from the pressure of the jet on the atmosphere. In fact, the jet propulsion engine, whether rocket, athodyd, or turbo-jet, is a piece of apparatus designed to accelerate a stream of air or gas and to expel it at high velocity. There are, of course, a number of ways of doing this, as described in Part 2, but in all instances the resultant reaction or thrust exerted on the engine is proportional to the mass or weight of air expelled by the engine and to the velocity change imparted to it. In other words, the same thrust can be provided either by giving a large mass of air a little extra velocity or a small mass of air a large extra velocity. In practice the former is preferred, since by lowering the jet velocity relative to the atmosphere a higher propulsive efficiency is obtained.

### 1.3 METHODS OF JET PROPULSION

1.1.10 The types of jet engine, whether ram jet, pulse jet, rocket, gas turbine, turbo/ram jet or turbo-rocket, differ only in the way in which the 'thrust provider', or engine, supplies and converts the energy into power for flight.

1.1.11 The ram jet engine (fig. 1-6) is an athodyd, or 'aero-thermodynamic-duct to give it its full name. It has no major rotating parts and consists of a duct with a divergent entry and a convergent or convergent-divergent exit. When forward motion is imparted to it from an external source, air is forced into the air intake where it loses velocity or kinetic energy and increases its pressure energy as it passes through the diverging duct. The total energy is then increased by the combustion of fuel, and the expanding gases accelerate to atmosphere through the outlet duct. A ram jet is often the power plant for missiles and .target vehicles; but is unsuitable as an aircraft power plant "because it requires forward motion imparting to it before any thrust is produced.

1.1.12 The pulse jet engine (fig. 1-7) uses the principle of intermittent combustion and unlike the ram jet it can be run at a static condition. The engine is formed by an aerodynamic duct similar to the ram jet but, due to the higher pressures involved, it is of more robust construction. The duct inlet has a series of inlet 'valves' that are spring-loaded into the open position. Air drawn through the open valves passes into the combustion chamber and is heated by the burning of fuel injected into the chamber. The resulting expansion causes a rise in pressure, forcing the valves to close, and the expanding gases are then ejected rearwards. A depression created by the exhausting gases allows the valves to open and repeat the cycle. Pulse jets have been designed for helicopter rotor propulsion and some dispense with inlet valves by careful design of the ducting to control the changing pressures of the resonating cycle. The pulse jet is unsuitable as an aircraft power plant because it has a high fuel consumption and is unable to equal the performance of the modern gas turbine engine.

1.1.13 Although a rocket engine (fig. 1-8) is a jet engine, it has one major difference in that it does not use atmospheric air as the propulsive fluid stream. Instead, it produces its own propelling fluid by the combustion of liquid or chemically decomposed fuel with oxygen, which it carries, thus enabling it to operate outside the earth's atmosphere. It is, therefore, only suitable for operation over short periods.

1.1.14 The application of the gas turbine to jet propulsion has avoided the inherent weakness of the rocket and the athodyd, for by the introduction of a turbine-driven compressor a means of producing thrust at low speeds is provided. The turbo-jet engine operates on the 'working cycle' as described in Part 2. It draws air from the atmosphere and after compressing and heating it, a process that occurs in all heat engines, the energy and momentum given to the air forces It out of the propelling nozzle at a velocity of up to 2,000 feet per second or about 1,400 miles per hour. On its way through the engine, the air gives up some of its energy and momentum to drive the turbine that powers the compressor.

1.1.15 The mechanical arrangement of the gas turbine engine is simple, for it consists of only two main rotating parts, a compressor (Part 3) and a turbine (Part 5), and one or a number of combustion chambers (Part 4). The mechanical arrangement of various gas turbine engines is shown in fig. 1 -9. This simplicity, however, does not apply to all aspects of the engine, for as described in subsequent Parts the thermo and aerodynamic problems are somewhat complex. They result from the high operating tem-peratures of the combustion chamber and turbine, the effects of varying flows across the compressor and turbine blades, and the design of the exhaust system through which the gases are ejected to form the propulsive jet.

1.1.16  At aircraft speeds below approximately 450 miles per hour, the pure jet engine is less efficient than a propeller-type engine, since its propulsive efficiency depends largely on its forward speed; the pure turbo-jet engine is, therefore, most suitable for high forward speeds. The propeller efficiency does, however, decrease rapidly above 350 miles per hour due to the disturbance of the airflow caused by the high blade-tip speeds of the propeller. These charac-teristics have led to some departure from the use of pure turbo-jet propulsion where aircraft operate at medium speeds by the introduction of a combination of propeller and gas turbine engine.

1.1.17 The advantages of the propeller/turbine combination have to some extent been offset by the introduction of the by-pass, ducted fan and propfan engines. These engines deal with larger comparative airflows and lower jet velocities than the pure jet engine, thus giving a propulsive efficiency (Part 21) which is comparable to that of the turbo-prop and exceeds that of the pure jet engine (fig. 1-10).

1.1.18 The turbo/ram jet engine (fig. 1-11) combines the turbo-jet engine (which is used for speeds up to Mach 3) with the ram jet engine, which has good performance at high Mach numbers.
![](https://aerozf.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/jetengine/fig1-11.jpg)
<div align="center" markdown="0"><font size="2"></font>Fig. 1-11 A turbo/ram jet engine. </div>

1.1.19 The engine is surrounded by a duct that has a variable intake at the front and an afterburning jet pipe with a variable nozzle at the rear. During take-off and acceleration, the engine functions as a con-ventional turbo-jet with the afterburner lit; at other flight conditions up to Mach 3, the afterburner is inoperative. As the aircraft accelerates through Mach 3, the turbo-jet is shut down and the intake air is diverted from the compressor, by guide vanes, and ducted straight into the afterburning jet pipe, which becomes a ram jet combustion chamber. This engine is suitable for an aircraft requiring high speed and sustained high Mach number cruise conditions where the engine operates in the ram jet mode.

1.1.20 The turbo-rocket engine (fig. 1-12) could be considered as an alternative engine to the turbo/ram jet; however, it has one major difference in that it carries its own oxygen to provide combustion,

<div align="center" markdown="0"><font size="2"></font>Fig. 1-12 A turbo-rocket engine. </div>

1.1.21 The engine has a low pressure compressor driven by a multi-stage turbine; the power to drive the turbine is derived from combustion of kerosine and liquid oxygen in a rocket-type combustion chamber. Since the gas temperature will be in the order of 3,500 deg. C, additional fuel is sprayed into the combustion chamber for cooling purposes before the gas enters the turbine. This fuel-rich mixture (gas) is then diluted with air from the compressor and the surplus fuel burnt in a conventional afterburning system.

1.1.22 Although the engine is smaller and lighter than the turbo/ram jet, it has a higher fuel consumption. This tends to make it more suitable for an interceptor or space-launcher type of aircraft that requires high speed, high altitude performance and normally has a flight plan that is entirely accelerative and of short duration.
